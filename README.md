This is a task scheduler simulator. some well-known algorithms are implemented.

Task scheduling in heterogeneous systems is an important topic and an NP-Complete problem for the high-performance execution of programs. Programs are made with a sequence of tasks that may have the prerequisites. For showing program we use DAG (directed acyclic graphs). In each graph, nodes are tasks, and edges show requirements. Each task has own process time on each processor. Also if a task wants to run on processor except for the processor that its parent ran, the transport time should be considered.
In this paper, we purpose a new hybrid algorithm by combining a list based algorithm with a metaheuristic algorithm. We use a list scheduling algorithm for creating entry population. Then we try to improve schedulings with using Simulated Annealing algorithm. Algorithm focuses on improving the length of scheduling and finding minimum makespan. The purposed algorithm is evaluated on different randomly generated DAGs, and result Compared with the well-known existing algorithms. The results of experiments show about 2% improvement in makespan.
